I misplaced my child's birth certificate with the registration number (2016-05-123456) on it. So, tried using my child's Statement of Live Birth Long-Version on the website but the website would not accept the registration number (2016-123456) because the website DOES NOT mention to INSERT the 05 in the registration number. The website just says to put in the registration number.... 

I had to call up Service Ontario to clarify things.. 
I'm annoyed that I had to run-around to find out this information. It should be explained on the website when filling out the registration number for the child and state where (documents other than official birth certificate) to find the number and what to do when 05 is missing on a Statement of Live Birth Long-Version. 

Please make the corrections ASAP. Thank you."

"November 21, 2024",2:46:47 PM,CXp_Guest,,"1) WHY do you need a Birth Registration Number when RENEWING a health card? Didn't you already get this info when issuing the card in the first place? It is extremely inconvenient to look this up again. Stop asking people to do busy-work that could be replaced by a quick database lookup on your end!!!
2) WHY do you need the parent's health card number (and the numbers on the back, no less!) What does this have to do with the child's health card?? What if the parent isn't OHIP-eligible but the child is, or the parent lost their card, etc? This should NOT affect the child's eligibility, and again just creates busy-work in filling the form.
3) WHY do you require typing in the health card number in a specific format (number-number-number-dash-number-etc)? Can't the computer format the number (e.g. fill in the dashes) by itself? This is just extremely lazy programming. I am in the software business and I would never let something like this be deployed to production, this is just horrible web UX design.
4) WHY require the child to be born in Ontario? What about immigrant children or children from other Canadian provinces that have been now living in Ontario for years??"

Box should not be what we have to type to find our location when the system asks for your postal code. Update system to have P.O. Box number as an option lower down after searching by town or postal code. Should not be this complicated to find a town that has existed for over 150 years and a house that was built in 1951.

"October 29, 2024",4:02:52 PM,CXp_Guest,,"You are preventing me from accessing this service while I am in Ottawa, which is part of Ontario."
"October 28, 2024",4:25:10 PM,CXp_Account,,I am trying to renew my sons health card but the system will not allow it stating I am trying to access from outside of Ontario when I live in Ontario.
"October 25, 2024",6:48:44 PM,CXp_Account,,"I'm in Ontario,in my home, in Ariss, Ontario, and your system will not let me renew my child's health card as it claims I'm currently outside of Ontario.  I need to take my child to the doctor's tonight and can't because of this online issue."
"October 25, 2024",2:52:32 PM,CXp_Guest,,"I gathered all required documents, entered all information twice and each time received a simple error message: ""Service not available at this time""

Because of maintenance? When should I try again?
Will I waste my time every time? Did I do something wrong?
Do I need to attend in person?

This was a total waste of time!!!!!!!!"
"October 25, 2024",4:06:02 PM,CXp_Guest,,"Make your server work. I put all info in, got to review screen and after hitting submit was told there was a problem with the system."
"October 25, 2024",10:35:31 AM,CXp_Guest,,"The address search function is not loading.  I started typing the address and then tried with postal code using cellphone, chrome and edge but none worked.  The search took forever to load and eventually timed out.  Now I have to take time off work and pull my child out of school to go to a Service Ontario location."
"October 25, 2024",3:21:23 PM,CXp_Guest,,The service is telling me that I am out of Ontario and cannot use the service at this time. I am sitting in my vehicle waiting for the bell to ring at my children's school in rural Ontario.
"October 25, 2024",2:15:30 PM,CXp_Guest,,"went through the entire process only to be notified ""this service is not available"".... what?!"
"October 24, 2024",4:27:54 PM,CXp_Account,,System says I'm outside of Ontario… but I'm in Ontario
"October 24, 2024",10:40:37 AM,CXp_Guest,,"One of the address, I was confused in the lot numbers like this"

"October 23, 2024",4:48:18 PM,CXp_Guest,,Why is it impossible to renew online if the child was not born in Canada? How can working parents visit Service Ontario in person? During their working Hours?
"October 22, 2024",2:49:01 PM,CXp_Guest,,By allowing the online application to function properly. Page was stuck on terms and conditions and the tried on my phone it told me I was applying from outside Ontario (I'm in Toronto)

"October 17, 2024",9:41:36 AM,CXp_Guest,,i didnt fine anything wrong and i got everything dun thank u
"October 17, 2024",2:54:56 PM,CXp_Guest,,"It wouldn't let me type my address, 1800 Davis dr W. It would auto full with the incorrect address. The euro around was to type the postal code, select the correct street.  Then use the cursor to move to the front and type the street number. Someone who is not tech savvy would never have figured it out.  It's 2024 and as a country we can't even figure out an online form. Bravo. I hope this gets corrected. Please call me and I can show you. This was done on mobile. 

God speed ??"
"October 15, 2024",7:52:10 PM,CXp_Guest,,not sure its really easy
"October 14, 2024",11:09:50 PM,CXp_Guest,,"I experienced a lot of glitching while using this application and had to re-enter the same information, multiple times. It was a bit frustrating to be honest."
"October 13, 2024",3:48:11 PM,CXp_Guest,,Service was down and I was not notified until after I completed an entire form. Very disappointed and frustrated.
"October 11, 2024",3:46:15 PM,CXp_Guest,,I do not think there is any improvements needed. This service was very easy to use and fast.
"October 11, 2024",11:40:00 PM,CXp_Guest,,its already perfect
"October 9, 2024",1:56:41 PM,CXp_Guest,,"Completed everything to then submit and be told the service is temporary unavailable.

Thank you."

"October 8, 2024",10:42:42 AM,CXp_Guest,,It says I am trying to access the services while I'm not in Ontario which is incorrect. I am at my residence in Ontario and can't access the renewal services

"September 30, 2024",2:40:29 PM,CXp_Guest,,I am beyond happy with the fact we no longer need to visit Service Ontario locations to get these things done. I have never in my life experienced such mistreatment from 90% of  the people I have had to deal with at those offices.
"September 30, 2024",9:49:50 AM,CXp_Guest,,n/a very simple to use
"September 30, 2024",10:36:50 PM,CXp_Guest,,nothing to improve
"September 30, 2024",6:05:02 PM,CXp_Guest,,The page to renew the health card should have a button to renew a child's health card at the top of the page so you know that is you scroll all the way down you would have found it
"September 26, 2024",10:18:13 AM,CXp_Guest,,Give out reminders of when it is time to renew Health Cards. I didn't realize his Health Card expired at 9 years old... Maybe more awareness would help others.
"September 23, 2024",11:05:01 AM,CXp_Guest,,Address look up acts weird and won't let delete a mistake once looked up. Had to select all and cut out wrong address to be able to add correct address.
"September 20, 2024",12:53:57 PM,CXp_Guest,,Have an email sent when the card is shipped for notification purposes
"September 19, 2024",9:37:48 PM,CXp_Guest,,"It would be nice if you would allow for French accents or at least update your error message. When I entered the accent aigue ""é"" on my child's name I got an error saying something like the name was incorrect. If you can't accept accents, you could at least say ""please enter your name without any accents or special characters"". Otherwise, very easy to use and quick. Merci! :)"
"September 18, 2024",1:47:04 PM,CXp_Guest,,I am very impressed with how easy this process was. Your online system is excellent.
"September 11, 2024",9:16:16 AM,CXp_Guest,,"Everything was quick, efficient and had all of the information needed. There are some typos though like at the end to confirm information is correct."
"September 9, 2024",1:47:16 PM,CXp_Guest,,Excellent! So east and fast to renew my daughters health card!  Thank you
"September 5, 2024",5:44:03 AM,CXp_Guest,,It was difficult to locate birth certificate number as the official document has it displayed differently. But overall quick and easy to use service.
"September 5, 2024",6:16:18 PM,CXp_Guest,,Its perfect.
"August 30, 2024",11:57:56 AM,CXp_Guest,,You are doing a great job. Keep it up.

Very satisfied with the system."
"August 12, 2024",12:16:08 PM,CXp_Guest,,Lucky to have a photo of birth certificate with me...renewing from cottage
"August 9, 2024",7:45:37 PM,CXp_Guest,,At the end I put my email in to receive the receipt and clicked the button but nothing changed on the screen so was not clear if it sent. I clicked it a couple times and ended up with multiple emails. Also not clear on if childs current health card which is shortly expiring will still be accepted as we wait 4-6 weeks. Is there an automatic extension? Will there be issues at clinics or with doctors? Clarity is needed and if an extension is not done then a change in process is needed to ensure continued health coverage.
"August 9, 2024",2:31:21 PM,CXp_Guest,,"It's fantastic that you can renew health cards online!  However, I had several issues when trying to enter our mailing address. The first time I tried, the system did not automatically complete my address. I typed my whole address in and hit ""continue"" and then discovered on the confirmation page that my address had been confirmed in an entirely different city. So I was unable to complete my form.

On the second try - when I typed our street number in Ottawa, the system automatically confirmed an address in Killarney, Ontario and would not let me change the town name or postal code.  I was about to give up entirely when my husband typed in Ottawa first, followed by our street address, which sorted things out.  But there was nothing to suggest that this was how it needed to be completed, which was frustrating."
"August 6, 2024",8:29:37 PM,CXp_Guest,,"The mailing address auto-fill was a bit of a pain, maybe because I was using a phone. I figured it out after a few tries but I think leaving it to be a manual would make it easier. Thanks."
"August 5, 2024",5:50:15 PM,CXp_Guest,,Thank you for making it so easy! Thank you for all the work that you do!
"August 4, 2024",2:52:26 PM,CXp_Guest,,The section that auto-generates addresses is glichy and it took ages to work out the right way to type my address so that an incorrect address wouldn't auto-populate.
"August 3, 2024",12:48:44 PM,CXp_Guest,,This is a very convenient way to renew your documents without traveling and standing in lines. I am glad ServiceOntario is providing services for people online now. Thank you!

"July 30, 2024",10:12:15 AM,CXp_Guest,,"a list of documents needed for a child's healt card renewal on the front page would be helpful, but otherwise, all was great and easy to navigate."
"July 26, 2024",6:17:37 PM,CXp_Guest,,Too many pieces of information to fill in.  Is it necessary to fill out birth certificate number on a renewal?
"July 22, 2024",8:47:19 PM,CXp_Guest,,"The address search is very difficult to use, and takes a learning curve. A simpler algorithm would be good, or allowing a person to simply search their street and add their address in. Needing to select the block of houses on a street is odd, and the system defaults to wrong addresses to easily."
"July 20, 2024",9:16:10 AM,CXp_Guest,,automatic tab to next field box

"July 12, 2024",10:50:01 PM,CXp_Guest,,Nice and quick process. Would be nice to know if it's approved at the end.

"July 5, 2024",8:40:06 AM,CXp_Guest,,"1.  my submission didn't go through for an unknown reason.  2. under the child's information part it asks for the number on the ""back of your card"" instead of the ""back of the child's card"".  This is confusing and I only realized it was for the child once I completed the part for the parent a few steps later."
"July 3, 2024",12:20:22 PM,CXp_Guest,,In my mail notification for there was no indication that I could complete this health card renewal online. This information would have been helpful at the receipt of my paper notification.
"July 2, 2024",11:20:12 AM,CXp_Guest,,I received a letter that did not give me an online option to renew but rather required that I mail in the renewal application form. I feel that I should have been given that option in the first place rather than have me seek it out myself.
"June 27, 2024",7:17:15 AM,CXp_Guest,,The service to renew our daughter's Health Card was very simple and easy to use. I'm not sure how we can improve upon on this unless there's a way to renew automatically without having to type in any info.

Was strange yet wanted to ensure it gets sent to my house.  If a person was clicking through fast would not get proper address autofilled go some other place.
"June 6, 2024",5:37:37 PM,CXp_Guest,,There was a glitch when entering my address. It kept automatically filling the field incorrectly so I had to redo it 3 times.
"June 5, 2024",11:52:35 PM,CXp_Guest,,"I had a hard time loading my address towards the end. For some reason, the online prompts could not locate my home address online automatically and kept giving me the wrong address. I had to update my address and change it to the same address. Once I did that I had to do the process of renewing my child's health card from the very beginning and eventually it found my home address the process took over 30 min."
